# UK Food Hygiene Ratings Analysis using MongoDB

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the process of importing, updating, and analyzing data from the UK Food Standards Agency. The data includes food hygiene ratings for various establishments in the United Kingdom. The analysis is conducted using MongoDB and Python.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb**: This notebook sets up the database, imports the data, and makes updates to the database according to the requirements of a food magazine.

2. **NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb**: This notebook performs exploratory analysis on the data using various queries, aggregations, and data manipulation techniques to answer specific questions related to the hygiene ratings of establishments.

The data for this project is provided in the Resources folder, which contains the `establishments.json` file.

This project demonstrates the use of MongoDB as a NoSQL database and the power of PyMongo for connecting, querying, and updating data within the database.
